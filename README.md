I've completed a series of JavaScript-focused projects to further enhance my coding skills. These projects include building dynamic web applications, interactive user interfaces, and real-time data visualizations.

I've also integrated jQuery into several of these projects to simplify DOM manipulation and enhance user experience.
By working on these projects, I have gained practical experience in using various JavaScript frameworks and libraries, improved my problem-solving abilities, and developed a deeper understanding of modern web development practices.
